# DreamTeam

More or less what each file does:

* `dreamteam_stapp.py`: streamlit app
* `dreamteam_model.py` and `beam_search.py`: secondary files of the streamlit app, used to make graphs, make teams and render visualizations.
* `participant.py`: already given file with class to manage the data
* `data/datathon_participants.json` and `data/datathon_participants_final.json`: raw and processed data respectively
* `data/results.csv`: results of computing all teams
* `dreamteam.ipynb`: notebook used to compute all teams (same code as in streamlit but shorter)
* `objective_preprocessing.py`: to preprocess a field in the json
> NOTE: All html files are temporary files used to render graph visualizations
